### A Deep Dive into Research Transparency

Our latest meta-research study, "Research Transparency in 59 Disciplines of Clinical Medicine," takes a comprehensive look at the state of transparency in clinical research. We analyzed thousands of publications to assess how openly and completely researchers are sharing their data, methods, and findings.

The study reveals both encouraging progress and persistent challenges. While many fields are embracing more transparent practices, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that our findings will serve as a catalyst for change, encouraging researchers, journals, and institutions to prioritize transparency and reproducibility.
