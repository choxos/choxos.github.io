Open access publishing has become a cornerstone of the open science movement, promising to democratize knowledge and make research freely available to everyone. Yet beneath this noble ideal lies a complex reality: the open access model has created new profit centers for publishers while sometimes placing additional burdens on researchers and potentially compromising research quality. Let’s explore why open access publishing presents such a nuanced challenge for truly open science.

### Understanding Open Access and Open Science

Before diving into the complexities, it’s important to understand what these terms mean. Open science refers to the broader movement to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all levels of society. Open access publishing is one component of this movement, focused specifically on making research publications freely available to readers, eliminating the traditional paywall system.

In theory, this sounds ideal — knowledge freely available to all. But the reality is more complicated.

### The Business Model Shift

Traditional scientific publishing operated on a relatively simple model: libraries and individuals paid subscription fees to access journals, and authors published for free. This model generated reliable revenue streams for publishers while restricting access to those who could afford subscriptions.

Open access flipped this model: readers access content for free, while authors (or their institutions or funders) pay Article Processing Charges (APCs) to publish. These APCs can range from a few hundred dollars to over $11,000 for prestigious journals.

This shift changed who pays, but not necessarily how much money flows to publishers. In fact, it may have increased it.

### The Publisher’s Profit Paradox

Major academic publishers quickly realized that open access could be extraordinarily profitable. Consider these dynamics:

- **Double-dipping opportunities**: During the transition to open access, many publishers maintained subscription fees while simultaneously collecting APCs, effectively getting paid twice for the same content.
- **Price inelasticity**: The prestige of certain journals allows publishers to charge premium APCs with little resistance, as researchers still need to publish in high-impact journals for career advancement.
- **Lower distribution costs**: Digital-only open access publishing eliminates printing and physical distribution costs, while publishers can still charge APCs comparable to what they collected from subscriptions.
- **Market consolidation**: Five major publishers — Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and SAGE — control over 50% of academic publishing, allowing them to set industry standards and maintain high APCs.

The result? The largest academic publishers have maintained or even increased profit margins — often 30–40% — that would be enviable in most industries. Elsevier’s parent company RELX, for example, consistently reports operating profit margins above 35% for its scientific publishing division.

### When Open Access Becomes Mandatory

Another complexity arises when open access becomes mandatory rather than optional. Increasingly, funding bodies and institutions require researchers to publish open access as a condition of their grants:

- Plan S, supported by major European funding agencies, requires all scientific publications from grant-funded research to be published in open access journals or platforms.
- The US National Institutes of Health requires all peer-reviewed publications from NIH-funded research to be immediately available to the public.
- Many universities have adopted open access mandates for faculty research.

While these policies aim to advance open science, they create a challenging situation for researchers who must now:

- Find the money to pay often substantial APCs
- Navigate complex policies and embargo periods
- Sometimes forgo publishing in their preferred journals if those journals don’t offer compliant open access options

The mandates effectively force researchers to become customers of open access publishing services, creating a captive market that publishers can exploit with high APCs.

### The Quality Question

Perhaps most concerning is the emergence of what critics call “predatory” open access journals. These publications prioritize revenue generation over research integrity by:

- **Minimal peer review**: Accepting articles with little or no meaningful peer review to maximize the number of paying authors
- **Volume-based business models**: Focusing on quantity rather than quality to increase revenue
- **Misleading metrics**: Using fake or manipulated impact factors to appear more prestigious
- **Opaque operations**: Lacking transparency about editorial boards, review processes, or business practices

Even among legitimate publishers, the APC model creates problematic incentives. When revenue comes directly from authors rather than subscribers, the financial incentive shifts toward accepting more papers rather than maintaining selectivity. Some “mega-journals” now publish tens of thousands of articles annually with acceptance rates far higher than traditional selective journals.

### Finding a Middle Path

This critique isn’t meant to dismiss open access entirely. The movement has genuinely democratized access to research and helped knowledge reach places and people previously excluded. However, recognizing these complexities can help us develop more nuanced approaches:

- **Exploring alternative funding models**: Some journals operate on “diamond” or “platinum” open access models where neither readers nor authors pay, with costs covered by institutions, societies, or grants.
- **Transparent APC structures**: Publishers could adopt sliding scales for APCs based on research funding levels, institutional resources, or geographic location.
- **Community-owned publishing**: Academic communities developing their own publishing platforms, controlled by scholars rather than for-profit entities.
- **Preprint culture**: Greater emphasis on preprints (preliminary versions shared before peer review) alongside formal publishing could reduce dependency on traditional journals.
- **Evaluating research differently**: Moving away from journal prestige as a primary metric for evaluating researchers could reduce the power of high-APC journals.

### The Path Forward

Open access publishing represents both progress and new challenges for open science. The question isn’t whether open access is good or bad, but rather how we can implement it in ways that truly serve science and society rather than simply shifting profits from one publishing model to another.

True open science requires not just open access to research papers, but thoughtful consideration of who bears the costs and who reaps the benefits. As we move forward, researchers, institutions, funders, and policymakers must work together to ensure that openness serves knowledge creation rather than merely creating new profit opportunities.

The future of open science depends not just on making research available, but on creating systems where the economics of publishing align with the core values of scientific inquiry: rigor, integrity, and the advancement of human knowledge.
