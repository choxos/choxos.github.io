    "abstract": "Orofacial clefts are the most common craniofacial anomalies that include a variety of conditions affecting the lips and oral cavity. They remain a significant global public health challenge. Despite this, the quality of care for orofacial clefts has not been investigated at global and country levels.We aimed to measure the quality-of-care index (QCI) for orofacial clefts worldwide.We used the 2019 Global Burden of Disease data to create a multifactorial index (QCI) to assess orofacial clefts globally and nationally. By utilizing data on incidence, prevalence, years of life lost, and years lived with disability, we defined four ratios to indirectly reflect the quality of healthcare. Subsequently, we conducted a principal component analysis to identify the most critical variables that could account for the observed variability. The outcome of this analysis was defined as the QCI for orofacial clefts. Following this, we tracked the QCI trends among males and females worldwide across various regions and countries, considering factors such as the socio-demographic index and World Bank classifications.Globally, the QCI for orofacial clefts exhibited a consistent upward trend from 1990 to 2019 (66.4 to 90.2) overall and for females (82.9 to 94.3) and males (72.8 to 93.6). In the year 2019, the top five countries with the highest QCI scores were as follows: Norway (QCI = 99.9), Ireland (99.4), France (99.4), Germany (99.3), the Netherlands (99.3), and Malta (99.3). Conversely, the five countries with the lowest QCI scores on a global scale in 2019 were Somalia (59.1), Niger (67.6), Burkina Faso (72.6), Ethiopia (73.0), and Mali (74.4 \u2026",

Using a negative binomial model, the relationship between the number of decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) of 12- and 15-year-old students and their primary source of oral health information was assessed. The sources of oral health information included parents, television, newspapers, the Internet, and social media. The adjusted model included age, sex, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). R was used for data handling, analysis and reporting.Overall, 2,372 children were assessed (48.7% female, 48.6% 12-year-old). For the majority, the primary source of oral health information was their parents (89.5%) followed by the Internet (43.4%). Over nine-tenth of the participants had a DMFT = 0. The adjusted model showed that the prevalence rate of DMFT for the children whose primary source of information is their parents (0.45) or television (0.62) is lower than 1. The prevalence rate for the Internet (1.17) and social media (1.67) was higher than 1, but they were removed from the final model due to being non-statistically significant. Age and deprivation had a direct relationship with the prevalence rate of DMFT, meaning that 15-year-olds and children from more deprived areas had a higher prevalence rate of DMFT.Children whose primary source of oral health information was their parents or television had a lower DMFT.

The number of citable documents 1996\u20132021 from SCImago was used to account for the population size of retractions.

We searched for \u201cdata/results not shown\u201d phrases from the full texts and then calculated the proportion of articles with the phrases in all the available articles. From studies published in 2021, we evaluated whether the phrases referred to confirmatory results, negative results, peripheral results, sensitivity analysis results, future results, or other/unclear results. Journal- and publisher-related differences in publishing studies with the phrases in 2021 were tested with Fisher\u2019s exact test using the R v4.1.1 software.The percentage of studies with the relevant phrases from the total number of studies in the database decreased from 13% to 3% between 2010 and 2020.

Variables analysed were working field, academic degree, total number of papers, papers per year, total number of citations, percentage of self-citation, h-index, g-index, citations per paper, gender, university type, number of years publishing, proportion of international papers, first-author papers, and corresponding-author papers. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests were used to analyse the relationship between background characteristics and scientometric indicators. The extracted data were analysed using R v4. 0.1.Results: The database included 1850 faculty members, of which about 60%(1104 of 1850) were women. Men (n= 746) had a higher number of papers (6583 vs 6255) and citations (60410 vs 39559) compared with women; 234 of the 376 faculty members with no papers were women.

Materials and methods All the published clinical trials within Cochrane oral health systematic reviews until 1 June 2020 were identified and examined. RoB was assessed for all the included clinical trials according to the Cochrane review standards. The Overall Risk of Bias (ORoB) was defined in this study using Cochrane\u2019s RoB tool-v2. Descriptive analyses were carried out to determine the frequency of each variable in the study sample. Results Out of a total of 2565 included studies, the majority (n = 1600) had sample sizes of 50 or higher. Regarding blinding, 907 studies were labelled as double-blind. Among the various domains of bias, the performance bias showed the highest rate of high risk (31.4%). Almost half of the studies had a high ORoB, compared to 11.1% with a low ORoB. The studies that used placebos had a higher percentage of low ORoB (14.8% vs. 10.7%). Additionally, the double- and triple-blind studies had higher percentages of low ORoB (23.6% and 23.3%, respectively), while the studies with a crossover design had the highest percentage of low ORoB (28.8%).

The Kruskal-Wallis test was used. The extracted data were analyzed using R v4. 0. 1 statistical software. Results A total of 21064 faculty members in 77 universities and institutes of medical sciences were registered in the ISID database, of which 12093 (57. 4%) were men. Men faculty members outnumbered women in all academic ranks, except for the \u201c, instructor\u201d, rank (1134 female instructors against 835 male).

Patients admitted for COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of all symptoms assessed, including OD (p<0.05 in all cases), and OD identified admitted patients with 84.0% sensitivity and 34.3% specificity.
